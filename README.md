# Craigslist_phone_numbers_extractor
This project is a web scraping application built using Python that extracts phone numbers from Craigslist postings. The application automates data collection by interacting with Craigslist listings, extracting relevant content (title, description, post date, and phone numbers), and saving it into Excel files for further analysis.
